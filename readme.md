# The Box From The Future

A design prompt generator based on the imagination game ["The Thing From The Future"](http://situationlab.org/projects/the-thing-from-the-future/) by Situation Lab.


By connecting 5 switches you are able to turn each category on or off customising the prompts for specific workshops or other occasions.

If you're interested in recieving one of these prompts every day you can take a look at my twitterbot "TheBotFromTheFuture" ([@BotFromFuture](https://twitter.com/BotFromFuture)).
